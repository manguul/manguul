4. Title of your project: Copying robot arm movements! game
5. Short description of the project:
There are a total of three components of the "Robot Arm" game. The first is the actual robotic arm that you have to copy, the second is the joystick in the form of the robotic arm, and the third is the shadow robotic arm that copies the joystick's movements. The goal of the project is to use a potentiometer to control the servo motor of the "Shadow Robot Arm" to create a game that describes the same form of the "Robot Arm."
1 Robot Arm - Use 4 actuators
2 Shadow robot arm - 4 actuators used
3 Joystick Robot Arm - Use 3 potentiometers and 1 switch
-Controlling the shadow robot arm using the joystick robot arm
- Change the range of the potentiometer to the same as the servo motor
6. 1. Instructions for users:
You need an additional 5 volt external power supply to control multiple actuators.
you need machine , random, time library components.
7. Comments:
The potentiometer used a potentiometer built into the sg90 servo motor. To do that, the servo motor was disassembled, and the signal pin of the potentiometer was soldered out and used. So, there is no potentiometer in the BOM.
